\section{ \textbf{Introduction}}

Today's supercomputer landscape is in flux.
%
Supercomputer architectures are undergoing more extreme changes than they have ever undergone in the past 20 years.
%
One big driving factor for this change is the concerns about power usage as we scale to larger and larger machines.
%
Modern machines are pushing up against a hard power limit, meaning that in order to increase performance they must become more power efficient.
%
Architectures are transitioning from fast and complex multi-core CPUs to much larger numbers of slower and simpler processors.
%
The amount of parallelism available on any given node in a supercomputer is growing by factors of hundreds or thousands because of this change.
%
This transition to many-core computing brings new and interesting challenges that need to be overcome.
%

%
In addition to the increase in node-level parallelism, it is unclear which many-core architecture choice will prove to be a winning design.
%
There are many different architectures to choose from when designing a supercomputer, and there is no obvious choice.
%
NVIDIA provides General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) which are highly parallel throughput-optimized devices.
%
Intel provides Many Integrated Core (MIC) co-processors which provide large vector lanes and many threads.
%
Another option is Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) which provide programmable logic circuits.
%
Across the Department of Energy (DOE) National Labs, both the NVIDIA and Intel technologies are being pursued in their newest procurements ~\cite{coralWeb, trinityWeb}.
%

Application developers now face a complex and unclear path forward.
%
There are additional levels of complexity and potentially large application changes in order to effectively utilize this increase in parallelism.
%
In addition, an application developer cannot simply port to a new hardware architecture.
%
Instead, the application developer must address the issue of portability as well as performance of their algorithms or risk those algorithms becoming outdated or unusable very quickly.
%
This problem is especially challenging when optimizations are architecture specific
%

%
Currently, there are a large number of physics and multi-physics applications that must understand how to navigate this complex and challenging landscape.
%
Simply porting to new architectures does not guarantee performance, and will still require applications to be ported individually to multiple architectures.
%
This paper will describe the current state of the art research for the Monte Carlo particle transport problem, evaluate portable performance solutions that have been made up to this point, and provide a proposal for future research to fill in the important gaps in knowledge found.
