\section{ \textbf{ State of the Art: Monte Carlo Research} }

There is a long history of research and improvements for Monte Carlo transport problems.
%
Further, understanding this path, and the machines that the approaches were designed for, helps to guide analysis of more recent efforts.
%
In the field of Monte Carlo transport, most research in the last 5 years has been related to one of the two topics: (1) GPGPU computing or (2) physics improvements (as opposed to computer-science based research).

Review and discussion of GPU research in Section~\ref{sec:SOTAGPU}.
%
This section looks at non-GPU Monte Carlo transport research, namely parallel performance on CPU architectures, parallel load balancing, optimizations in nuclear data look-ups, and variance reduction research.
