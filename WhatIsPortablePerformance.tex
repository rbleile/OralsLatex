\section{What is Portable Performance}

The term portable performance generally means the ability to achieve a high level of performance on a variety of architectures.

In this case high performance is relative to each target system~\cite{michaelwolfe2016}.

One important consideration then is what variety of systems are used that applications need to be portable for.

The top ranked machines in the world currently utilize technologies like general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs, e.g., NVIDIA Tesla in Titan ), many-core co-processors (e.g., Intel Xeon Phi in Tianhe-2), and large multi-core CPUs (e.g., IBM Power, Intel Xeon in Tianhe-2 and others)~\cite{michaelwolfe2016},~\cite{top500thelist2016},~\cite{hankchilds2015}. 
%
Further, future supercomputing designs may include low-power architectures (e.g., ARM), hybrid designs (e.g., AMD APU), or experimental designs (e.g., FPGA systems)~\cite{hankchilds2015}.

Given this wide array of possible architectures the value of portable performance has never before been so high.
