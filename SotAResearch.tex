\section{State of the Art Research}

In order to understand the state of the art research in Monte Carlo transport, it is important to have some perspective on what has been done in the field already.
%
There is a long history of research and improvements for Monte Carlo transport problems and understanding this path and the machines that that research was designed for can help guide analysis of more recent efforts.
%
In the field of Monte Carlo transport most research in the last 5 years has been related to GPGPU computing or has been physics based as apposed to computer science based research.
%
We will review and discuss the GPU research in a later section.
%
In this section we will look at the significant areas of interest when dealing with Monte Carlo transport applications that do not pertain to GPUs, namely Parallel performance on different architectures, load balancing optimizations, optimizations in nuclear data look-ups, and optimizations dealing with variance reductions.
